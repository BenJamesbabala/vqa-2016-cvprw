Details of the proposed solutions will be posted after the deadline.\r\n\r\n<!--| ![Issey Masuda Mora][image-issey] | ![Xavier Giró-i-Nieto][image-xavier] | ![Santiago Pascual de la Puente][image-santi] |-->\r\n| Main contributor | Advisor | Co-advisor |\r\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\r\n| Issey Masuda Mora | Xavier Giró-i-Nieto | Santiago Pascual de la Puente |\r\n\r\nInstitution: [Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya](http://www.upc.edu).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nDeep learning techniques have been proven to be a great success for some basic perceptual tasks like object detection and recognition. \r\nThey have also shown good performance on tasks such as image captioning but these models are not that good when a higher reasoning is needed.\r\n\r\nVisual Question-Answering tasks require the model to have a much deeper comprehension and understanding of the scene and the realtions between the objects\r\nin it than that required for image captioning. The aim of these tasks is to be able to predict an answer given a question related to an image.\r\n\r\nDifferent scenarios have been proposed to tackle this problem, from multiple-choice to open-ended questions. Here we have only addressed the\r\nopen-ended model.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What are you going to find here\r\n\r\nThis project gives a baseline code to start developing on Visual Question-Answering tasks, specifically those focused on the [VQA challenge][vqa-challenge]. Here you will find\r\nan example on how to implement your models with [Keras][keras] and train, validate and test them on the [VQA dataset][vqa-dataset]. Note that we are still building things upon this \r\nproject so the code is not ready to be imported as a module but we would like to share it with the community to give a starting point for newcomers. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis project is build using the [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) library for Deep Learning, which can use as a backend both [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) \r\nand [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).\r\n\r\nWe have used Theano in order to develop the project and it has not been tested with TensorFlow.\r\n\r\nFor a further and more complete of all the dependencies used within this project, check out the requirements.txt provided in the project. This file will help you to recreate the exact\r\nsame Python environment that we worked with.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project structure\r\n\r\nThe main files/dir are the following:\r\n\r\n* bin: all the scripts that uses the vqa module are here. This is your entry point.\r\n* data: the get_dataset.py script will download the whole dataset for you and place it where it can access it. Alternatively, you can provide the route of\r\nthe dataset if you have already downloaded it. The vqa module created some directory structure to place preprocessed files\r\n* vqa: this is a python package with the core of the project\r\n* requirements.txt: to be able to reproduce the python environment. You only need to do `pip install` in the project's root and it will install all\r\nthe dependencies needed\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related work\r\n\r\n* Ren, Mengye, Ryan Kiros, and Richard Zemel.
